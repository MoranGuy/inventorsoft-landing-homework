# CSS Landing Homework for Inventorsoft Academy

**Task description**:
I've decided to make a landing page for my personal portfolio. It was the first time I had to work with SASS.

**Topics from lecture that I've used in this homework**:

- Absolute and relative units (px, em, rem, vh, vw, %)
- Selectors (main, relative, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements)
- Flexbox and grid
- Positioning (relative, absolute, fixed)
- CSS Animation (little ball on "scroll" icon and arrow on the bottom of the page)
- Media Queries for responsive design
- All code was written using SASS (variables, nesting, mixins, partials)
